Honestly... do you really care about this?
It's a memory technique and the code is less-old and less-crufty. than it was

It has a few notable things going on:

* OpenID for login
* Uses flickr (json api!) to grab images for each of your pegs

beyond that, I honestly doubt there's another soul out there that would use this.
